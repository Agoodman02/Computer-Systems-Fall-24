	Session 1: 
		Created a new thread for each plane
		made the plane actions into a function
		
1. Try running your program with only 9 passengers. What happens? Why?

	The program will deadlock because there are not enough passengers for atleast one plane to be full and 
	take off. 
	
2. Try running your program with 10 passengers. What happens? Why?
3. Try running your program with 42 passengers and 100 tours. What happens? why?
4. Try running your program with 79 passengers and 20 tours. What happens? Why?
5. What is the minimum number of passengers that will guarantee avoidance of
deadlock? Why?
